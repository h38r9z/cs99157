Module 2 Assignment:   Identification and Quantification of Proteins    Metabolites
Question   1. Study   Design   (30% of   assignment)
Background
Biomarkers   indicate associations   between   biological   measurements and states of   health   and   wellness at the subcellular, cellular,   system,   and   organism   levels.   Proteomics   advances   allow   us to detect   and   quantify thousands of   proteins at   a   time,   leading   to   the   discovery   of   an   avalanche of   potential   biomarkers.   However, critical   steps   in experimental   design are   often   neglected and the failure to validate candidate   biomarkers   results   in   a   lack   of   experimental   rigor,   data   reproducibility, and   identification of   biomarkers. To standardized   biomarker   studies, experimental   designs   now   include two fundamental   steps;   1)   identification of   proteins as candidate   biomarkers and   2) verification   of the   identity   and   differential   expression of the candidate   biomarkers.   Implementing   methodical   experimental   design at each step ensures   robust,   reproducible data, allowing   meaningful   biological   interpretations   of candidate   biomarkers   increasing the   likelihood of   discovering   relevant, actionable biomarkers.
Task
You   are   designing abiomarker study   using mass-spectrometry-based   proteomic analysis,   please   outline   your   approach   for   the   1) biomarker   identification, and   2) biomarker   verification   steps   in your study.   Describe the   key   steps   in your workflow,   include   your   rationale   and   any   considerations when using these workflows for such   studies.
You   may include diagrams/tables   and   references.   References should   be   in the   style. of the   Journal of   Biochemistry   and   Molecular Science.   Maximum 400 words,   references and   figures   do   not count towards the word   limit.
Question   2. Sample   Preparation   (30% of   assignment)
Background
Metabolites   have complex   chemical   structures, often   requiring   chemical   modifications   for suitable analysis.   Derivatization   is commonly   used for   metabolomics studies to   enable   large   scale   metabolite analysis on   GC-MS.
TaskDiscuss the   importance,   purpose   and types   of derivatizations   used for GC-MS.   Please   detail   the   biochemical   mechanisms, target groups   and   usage   of thesederivatizations,   highlighting   their advantages   and   disadvantages.
You   may include diagrams/tables   and   references.   References should   be   in the   style. of the   Journal of   Biochemistry   and   Molecular Science.   Maximum 400 words,   references and   figures   do   not count towards the word   limit.
Question   3.   Data   visualization   and   analysis   (40% of   assignment)
Proteomics and   m代 写Module 2 Assignment: Identification and Quantification of Proteins & MetabolitesStatistics
代做程序编程语言etabolomics studies   produce   large datasets which   require sophisticated   data   processing, visualization, and   analysis.   Data   analysis   pipelines can   be completed efficiently   in   programs such as   MS-DIAL.
First   download and set-up the   MS-DIAL   program and the   sample   dataset   using   the   instructions   provided and take   sometime   exploring the   program.
‘Assignment      2      MSDial_setup_instructions’
Next, following the ‘MS-DIAL Tutorial’ you will   analyze and   visualize the   dataset   and   describe   your   data   results.
Please follow the   instructions   below and   answer the   corresponding   questions as   complete   but short answers, you   may   include graphics from your   analysis.
1.   Explore   the   features.
Question   a)   How   many   compounds were   detected?
Question   b)   How   many   compounds were   identified   matching the   library?
2. Compound   search.
•   Here   can   change   the   result   for   each   compound   of   interest.
• Sort   by   dot   prod.   (This   is   a   type   of   confidence.)
Question   c) What do   ion   matches with very   low and   very   high   numbers   look   like?
Question   d) Compare   and describe the   EI spectra   between the   measurement   (Mass   spectrum   acquired) and the   reference (database).
3. Click on Show   ion table   (this   is   all   the   compounds that   were   detected   and   identified   from   the database   search.
•   Here   you   can   sort   the   data   by:
o   p-value   (how   significant   the   difference   is)
o   Fold   change   (how   large   the   difference   is)
o   S/N – signal   to   noise   (how   large   the   peak   in   the   chromatogram)
Question   e)   How   many   compounds   were   significantly   different   (p<0.05)   between   the   two Groups?
Question f) What was the   largest fold   change,   in   what   direction and   for   what   metabolite?
4.   Data   visualisation
• Select   ‘Data   Visualisation’
• Click   ‘normalisation’
• Select   ‘Total   Ion   Chromatogram   (TIC)’
•   Now work through each of   the   data   visualisation   methods
Question g)   Perform   a   PCA, describe   if you   used   all compounds detected and   why?
Question   h)   Describe   the   PCA   plot   and   explain   what   %   of   variation   is   explained   by   PC1   and PC2?
5.   Create   a   partial   least   square   plot   PLS
Question   i)   Does the   distributing   of samples   change when you include/exclude   unknown   compounds?   Describe   and   if it   is different from the   PCA   result.
Question j)   In which group   can you   see   more   variation?
Question   k)   How   can you interrogate the variation within   the   MeKO   group   further?
